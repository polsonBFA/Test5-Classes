# Chapter 3 Test - Coding exercises

Complete the following exercises in GitHub. There is an assignment created for you.
The GitHub document has an outline for the methods that you need to complete..
Instructions are posted within the GitHub ReadMe file, though a copy of the programming tasks can be found below.

**Exercise 1**
Write a method that takes an integer as input and returns true if the number is even and false otherwise.


**Exercise 2**
Write a method that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as inputs. The method output should indicate if the triangle is an equilateral triangle (e.g. all three sides are equal), or if the triangle is isosceles (e.g. two sides are equal). For example, triangleType(1,3,1) should return "isoceles", and triangleType(2,2,2) returns "equilateral", while triangleType(3,4,5) returns "triangle".



**Exercise 3**
Write a method to classify a number as positive, negative, zero, even, or odd.
Conditions:
If the number is positive and even, print "Positive Even".
If the number is positive and odd, print "Positive Odd".
If the number is negative and even, print "Negative Even".
If the number is negative and odd, print "Negative Odd".
If the number is zero, print "Zero".



**Exercise 4**
Write a method
```java
public static boolean isLater(int month1, int day1, int year1, int month2, int day2, int year2)
```
that returns true if the first date is later than the second and false otherwise.
